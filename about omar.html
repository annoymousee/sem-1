            Omar was born on 23rd October 2009 in a mulslim family. He has a sister who was 3years old at that time. His sister's name is Rida.
             Omar grew up in India and joined Kchigh in 2014 in Bright Bunnies (preprimary).

            preprimary school and now they are now in primary school. Sadly they got seperated in grade 1 when they were assigned in
        different classes. Omar did makes new friends Arhan is one them. They slowly lost contact but they were reunited in grade 3.
